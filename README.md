# Crack propagation

This is a finite element code based in deal.II to simulate crack propagation
in elastic and porous media.

Features:
- phase field approach for the crack location
- primal-dual active set method for the irreversibility constraint
- novel adaptive mesh refinement technique

This is the example program to accompany the paper
